Inspired a post by the [PM for Analytics](https://medium.com/p/c87517ab52b1) at SFDC. Although I'm a great fan of D3 the complexity of the library makes it difficult for beginners so I've created a few examples of using the Analytics API with Google Charts.

## Demo 1 - Stacked Barchart (Matrix Report)
